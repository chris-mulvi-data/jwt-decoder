# JWT-Decoder

This was a "why not" type of project.  There may be many web based tools for
decoding JWTs but I really like working in my terminal rather than bouncing
between tabs in a browser.

Not to mention that there may be a case where the content of a JWT may be
sensitive and copy/paste to some web tool may or may not be the best idea.

## Setup
Running the `setup.sh` script will check that go is installed then compile the
binary.
